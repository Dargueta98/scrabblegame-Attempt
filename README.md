learned about the drag and drop jQuery UI and tried to implement it in a scrabble game

GUI Assignment: Create a scrabble game with the use of your own algorithma and jQuert drag and drop
Daury Argueta, UMass Lowell Computer Science, daury_argueta@student.uml.edu 

Purpose:
The purposes of this assignment are to give me additional experience
 working with the jQuery UI and to pull together much of what we have learn and
 done this semester. I had to implement a bit of the game of Scrabble using
 drag-and-drop. This drag-and-drop method allows the elements to be dropped with 
 the help of mouse. Using jQuery UI, we can make the DOM(Document Object Model) 
 elements to drop anywhere within the view port on the specified target. The idea 
 is to display one line of a scrabble board to the user along with seven letter tiles on
 a tile rack.

 contination of purpose of assignment: I had to figure out a algorithm to 
 indentiy which letter tile was dragged to which block and had to 
 implement the algorithm to tall the score of the users word after indicates that all the tiles
 in the word have been completely played.
 
 Positive:
 I am happy I was atleast able to understand on how the drop and drag UI jQuery feature worked. I was able to implement that, and was able to move
 some tiles from my tile rack onto the scrabble board.
 
 fallback:
 Unforuntately I was not able to fullfill the assignment. I research as much as I could on how to work on a algorithm on to make this game possible,
 but I feel I need more practice with the basics before getting to this level. I reached out to classmates and also the TA, but unfortunately they themselves did not have as many resources to share. I did not or coudl figure out how to connect the source that explained to me about how the drop and drag worked with how to randomize tiles in the tile rack to then drag those randomized tiles to the scrabble board I will continue practicing the basics of html, css and mostly jQuery and the UI.
