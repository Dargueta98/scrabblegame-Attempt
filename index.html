GUI Assignment: Create a scrabble game with the use of your own algorithma and jQuert drag and drop
Daury Argueta, UMass Lowell Computer Science, daury_argueta@student.uml.edu 

Purpose:
The purposes of this assignment are to give me additional experience
 working with the jQuery UI and to pull together much of what we have learn and
 done this semester. I had to implement a bit of the game of Scrabble using
 drag-and-drop. This drag-and-drop method allows the elements to be dropped with 
 the help of mouse. Using jQuery UI, we can make the DOM(Document Object Model) 
 elements to drop anywhere within the view port on the specified target. The idea 
 is to display one line of a scrabble board to the user along with seven letter tiles on
 a tile rack.

 contination of purpose of assignment: I had to figure out a algorithm to 
 indentiy which letter tile was dragged to which block and had to 
 implement the algorithm to tall the score of the users word after indicates that all the tiles
 in the word have been completely played.
